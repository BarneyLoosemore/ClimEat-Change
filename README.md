Frontend component of ClimEat Change, backend is here: https://github.com/BarneyLoosemore/ClimEat-Back-End

This was my final project for the Flatiron software development course - this webapp shows you the carbon footprint of an array of recipes, with a searchbar to query recipes by name. Using React on the front-end and Ruby/Ruby-on-Rails for backend. 

The recipes were scraped from the BBC GoodFood's site using Watir, and I used a number of public studies on the carbon footprint of individual ingredients (e.g. beef, onions, etc.) as data points in the calculation of CO2 emissions for a particular recipe. I'm passionate about both food and climate change so saw this as an opportunity to combine the two in a meaningful way by showing people how seemingly benign habits can have such a comparatively large impact on our environment.
